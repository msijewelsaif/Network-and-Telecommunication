Network Lab Task and Solutions

Task: As part of my CCNA/Computer Network and Telecommunication course, I was assigned a mini-project in the network lab.

Solution:

For my mini-project, I have designed and implemented various network tasks to enhance my understanding of CCNA concepts. Here's an overview of the tasks and their solutions:

Network Topology Design: I began by designing a network topology that incorporated routers, switches, and end devices. This topology simulated a small office network environment.

IP Addressing Scheme: I devised an IP addressing scheme using both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing to allocate addresses to different network segments. Subnetting techniques were employed to optimize address allocation and facilitate efficient routing.

Router Configuration: Each router in the network was configured with appropriate routing protocols such as OSPF or EIGRP to enable dynamic routing. Access control lists (ACLs) were also implemented to enforce security policies.

Switch Configuration: Switches were configured with VLANs to logically segregate network traffic and improve network performance. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) was enabled to prevent network loops and ensure redundancy.

Inter-VLAN Routing: I implemented inter-VLAN routing to enable communication between devices residing in different VLANs. This involved configuring router interfaces and creating virtual interfaces (SVIs) for each VLAN.

Network Monitoring: I deployed network monitoring tools such as SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) to monitor network performance and detect any anomalies. This helped in proactive network management and troubleshooting.

Troubleshooting Scenarios: I simulated various network troubleshooting scenarios, such as connectivity issues, VLAN misconfigurations, and routing problems. Through systematic troubleshooting techniques, I identified and resolved these issues to ensure network reliability.

Documentation: Comprehensive documentation was prepared for each task, including network diagrams, configuration files, and troubleshooting procedures. This documentation served as a valuable reference for future network maintenance and expansion.
